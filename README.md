# Problem 2
Given the complexity of archiving large microscope datasets and your specific requirements, here's a suggested strategy and an outline of a Bash script to prepare and archive the data to tape. This approach focuses on creating an organized, versioned, and efficient archiving process:

**Strategy: Efficient and Versioned Archiving**

1. **Organize and Structure Data:**
   Maintain a well-structured directory hierarchy for the data on your "soma_fs" file system. Each level corresponds to a specific category (wafer, sections, FOVs) and aids in easy retrieval and updates.

2. **Incremental Updates:**
   Instead of rearchiving the entire dataset, implement a strategy that allows you to perform incremental updates. This ensures that only new or modified data are transferred and archived.

3. **Versioning:**
   Implement a versioning mechanism that keeps track of changes to the dataset. This way, you can access previous versions when needed.

4. **Data Integrity and Verification:**
   Implement checksums or hashing mechanisms to ensure data integrity during transfer and archival.

5. **Efficient Data Transfer:**
   Utilize a protocol that takes advantage of the 10G internet connection for efficient data transfer. Consider using protocols like rsync or SCP.

6. **Archive Metadata:**
   Maintain metadata that describes the archived datasets, including timestamps, version information, and descriptions.

**Bash Script: Data Preparation and Archival**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Paths and variables
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/soma_fs"        # Source directory
TAPE_MOUNT="/path/to/tape/mount"    # Mount point of the tape backup
ARCHIVE_NAME="data_archive_$(date +'%Y%m%d').tar.gz"  # Archive name
LOG_FILE="archive_log_$(date +'%Y%m%d').log"          # Log file name

# Log function
log() {
    echo "$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Step 1: Prepare data for archiving
log "Archiving data..."
tar -czf "$ARCHIVE_NAME" -C "$SOURCE_DIR" .

# Step 2: Copy archived data to tape
log "Copying data to tape..."
cp "$ARCHIVE_NAME" "$TAPE_MOUNT"

# Step 3: Verify data integrity
log "Verifying data integrity..."
# Implement checksum verification here

# Step 4: Clean up
log "Cleaning up..."
rm "$ARCHIVE_NAME"

log "Archival process completed."
```

Remember to customize the script by replacing `/path/to/soma_fs` and `/path/to/tape/mount` with your actual source and destination paths. Also, implement the checksum verification mechanism based on your needs.

This script is a basic outline and should be thoroughly tested in a controlled environment before using it for critical archiving operations. Additionally, consider incorporating error handling, logging, and other necessary security measures based on your organization's policies and requirements.


To automate the archiving process using GitHub Actions, you can set up a workflow that triggers on certain events, such as pushing to a specific branch, and then uses a self-hosted runner to execute the archiving script. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Set Up Self-Hosted Runner:**

   - Install and configure a self-hosted runner on a machine in your environment. This runner will be used to execute the archiving script.

2. **Create the Archiving Script:**

   - Create a version of the archiving script that you've outlined earlier, making sure it works correctly in your environment.

3. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**

   - In your repository, create a new YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/archive.yml`) to define the GitHub Actions workflow.

   - Define the workflow to trigger on specific events, such as pushes to a certain branch, manual triggers, or on a schedule.

   - Specify the jobs and steps that need to be executed in the workflow. In this case, you'll need a job that runs the archiving script using the self-hosted runner.

4. **Configure the Workflow:**

   - Specify the runner you want to use for this workflow. You can do this by assigning a label to the runner during its configuration, and then referencing that label in the workflow YAML.

   - Set up any environment variables or secrets that the archiving script might need.

5. **Run the Workflow:**

   - Commit and push your changes to trigger the workflow based on the defined conditions.

   - GitHub Actions will automatically execute the workflow, which will run the archiving script on the self-hosted runner.

Here's an example YAML for the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Archive Data

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Change this to the desired branch

jobs:
  archive:
    runs-on: self-hosted  # Replace with the label of your self-hosted runner

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Run Archiving Script
      run: |
        chmod +x archiving_script.sh
        ./archiving_script.sh  # Replace with the actual script name

    - name: Upload Log to Artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: archive-log
        path: archive_log_*.log  # Replace with the actual log file name
```

In this example, replace placeholders like `archiving_script.sh`, `archive_log_*.log`, and others with actual values corresponding to your setup.

Make sure to thoroughly test your workflow and archiving script to ensure they work as expected. Also, consider setting up additional steps, such as sending notifications on completion or handling potential failures.


# Problem 3

Creating a complete and effective Bash script for configuring an HPC cluster's power-saving measures using SLURM involves multiple complex steps that require thorough understanding of both SLURM and the cluster's hardware. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Bash script that demonstrates the concept of adjusting SLURM settings for power savings during low utilization periods.

Please note that this script is a starting point and may need to be customized according to your cluster's setup, SLURM configuration, and specific power-saving strategies.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set SLURM configurations for power savings during low utilization

# Idle node detection and standby mode
IDLE_THRESHOLD=10  # Example: Set a utilization threshold for idle nodes (percentage)
STANDBY_POWER_STATE="standby"  # Example: Power-saving state when nodes are idle

# Energy-efficient queue settings
EFFICIENT_QUEUE="energy_efficient"  # Example: Queue name for energy-efficient jobs
EFFICIENT_PRIORITY=100  # Example: Priority for the energy-efficient queue

# Dynamic rescheduling during moderate utilization
CONSOLIDATION_SCRIPT="/path/to/consolidation_script.sh"  # Example: Path to the consolidation script

# Predictive scheduling settings
PREDICTIVE_SCRIPT="/path/to/predictive_script.sh"  # Example: Path to the predictive script

# Set SLURM configurations
scontrol update NodeName=ALL State=${STANDBY_POWER_STATE}
scontrol create PartitionName=$EFFICIENT_QUEUE Priority=$EFFICIENT_PRIORITY

# Run dynamic rescheduling script during moderate utilization
if [ -f "$CONSOLIDATION_SCRIPT" ]; then
    $CONSOLIDATION_SCRIPT
fi

# Run predictive scheduling script
if [ -f "$PREDICTIVE_SCRIPT" ]; then
    $PREDICTIVE_SCRIPT
fi

echo "SLURM power-saving configurations updated."
```

Please replace placeholders (`/path/to/...`) with actual paths to your scripts and adjust the settings based on your cluster's configuration. The provided script demonstrates some basic concepts, including updating node states, creating an energy-efficient queue, and running custom scripts for dynamic rescheduling and predictive scheduling.

It's important to note that real-world implementation requires a more comprehensive approach, possibly involving database integration, real-time monitoring, and more sophisticated power-saving strategies. Additionally, these scripts need to be developed and tested carefully in a controlled environment before applying them to a production cluster.
